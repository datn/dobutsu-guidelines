## Welcome to Dobutsu Guidelines

tl:dr -- this is a project coming out of the Animal Crossing community from the XOXO Festival Slack based off the social norms the community has built out (semi-ringlead by myself as primary Animal Crossing fan/ringleader).

## Goals
Write up basic etiquette on how to play with other folx playing Animal Crossing New Horizons that other groups can use as community guidelines to help build robust, compassionate, friendly communities focusing on a gift economy, because charging an entrance fee to your island is kind of gross.

## Timeline
Uhâ€¦ I'll work on this as I can?
